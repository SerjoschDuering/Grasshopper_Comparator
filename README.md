# Grasshopper Code Comparator

**Grasshopper Code Comparator** is a web-based visualization tool designed to compare different versions of Grasshopper definitions. This tool allows users to visually analyze changes, additions, and deletions between two versions of their Grasshopper scripts through interactive graphical representations. Users can either upload JSON files generated from Grasshopper or synchronize data directly using Speckle.

*In the morph view, you can smoothly transition back and forth between two versions of Grasshopper definitions, visually highlighting changes.*

## Features

- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Visualize both the current and previous versions of a Grasshopper definition simultaneously, highlighting added, removed, changed, and unchanged components.

- **Morphing View**: Smoothly transition between the old and new versions of the Grasshopper definition to dynamically observe changes.

- **Data Source Configuration**: Flexible setup to manage data sources. Users can upload JSON files or sync data from Speckle, a platform for managing design data.

- **UUID Syncing**: Sync selected nodes or components between the dashboard and open Grasshopper definitions via Speckle, enabling dynamic updates and synchronization.

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Provides a detailed visualization of Grasshopper definitions, including node attributes, edges, and changes. Supports interactive selection, filtering, and zooming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Grasshopper**: Ensure Grasshopper is installed and can run Python scripts.
- **Speckle Account**: Required for synchronizing data. Set up an account on Speckle to use its API for data retrieval and updates.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grasshopper-code-comparator.git
   cd grasshopper-code-comparator
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Generate JSON Files**:
   - Utilize the Grasshopper snippet provided in the repository (found in the `Grasshopper` folder) to generate JSON files representing your Grasshopper definitions.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Bokeh server to launch the web application:
   Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory (one level before "myapp") and enter the command:

   ```bash
   bokeh serve myapp.py
   ```

3. **Uploading or Syncing Data**:
   - In the web interface, you have two options:
     - **Upload JSON Files**: Manually upload JSON files for both the current and previous versions of the Grasshopper definition.
     - **Sync with Speckle**: Enter your Speckle credentials to fetch data directly from your Speckle streams.

4. **Visual Comparison**:
   - **Split View**: Displays the current and previous versions side by side, allowing for direct comparison of changes, additions, and removals.
   - **Morph View**: Provides a morphing transition between the versions, helping to visualize modifications over time.

5. **UUID Syncing (Optional)**:
   - Use the UUID Syncing feature to sync selected nodes or components between Grasshopper and the web interface. This feature helps in maintaining consistency and synchronizing changes dynamically.

### Screenshots

#### 1. Side-by-Side Comparison

The split view mode highlights differences between the current and previous Grasshopper definitions, categorizing them as added, removed, changed, or unchanged.

#### 2. Morphing View

Morphing view facilitates a smooth transition between different versions, making it easier to observe the evolution of the Grasshopper definition.

#### 3. Settings Panel

![Settings Panel](myapp/docs/Tools.jpg)
You can open the left side panel by clicking the settings icon on the buttom left.
The settings panel allows you to configure your data source, either by uploading JSON files or synchronizing through Speckle. Optionally, you can provide a speckle stream ID and branch name that is used to sync IDs of selected nodes/compomnents. Additionally, the left panel provides tools to select upstream and downstream components/nodes, trigger syncing selected UUIDs to Speckle, or fetch from Speckle.

### Notes

- **Data Handling**: This tool currently does not maintain a persistent storage or database for data management. All data operations are performed locally or via live syncing with Speckle during a session.
- **Speckle Synchronization**: The tool utilizes Speckle for data synchronization, enabling dynamic updates and UUID syncing between Grasshopper definitions and the web interface.
